# 📝 MERN ToDo List App

Welcome! This is a simple yet fully functional **ToDo list app** built using the **MERN stack** — that's **MongoDB**, **Express**, **React**, and **Node.js**.

You can use it to keep track of your tasks, mark them as complete, delete them, and more. It's a great example of how frontend and backend can work together in a modern web app.
